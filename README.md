## 📖 Project Concept

This application is designed to solve the two biggest problems writers face: **"Blank Page Syndrome"** and the struggle of **Organizing Research**. 

Unlike a standard chatbot that answers from general knowledge, this tool acts as a **"Brain for your PDFs."** It remembers every detail of your source material and helps you draft content that is 100% accurate to your research.

## 🛠️ How It Works

### 1. Knowledge Ingestion
When you upload a PDF, the system performs a "deep read." It breaks the document into small, manageable pieces and creates a mathematical map of the meanings behind the words. This allows the AI to find facts instantly, even if the keywords don't match perfectly.

### 2. Intelligent Outlining
Based on your topic, the AI suggests a logical structure for your essay. It looks at the start and end of your PDF to understand the context and provides headers (like Introduction, Analysis, and Conclusion) that fit your specific document.

### 3. "Grounded" Writing
This is the core of the experience. For every section you write:
* The system **retrieves** the most relevant facts from your PDF.
* The AI **drafts** the text using *only* those facts.
* This prevents "hallucinations" (the AI making things up) and ensures your essay is strictly based on your research.

### 4. Automatic Citations
Because the system knows exactly which chunk of text came from which page, it can track your sources automatically. This makes creating bibliographies and in-text citations effortless.
